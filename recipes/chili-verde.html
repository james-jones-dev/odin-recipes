    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut pork roast into 1/2 inch cubes.</li>
        <li>Heat the coconut oil over medium high in a large soup pot and add the pork once the oil is hot enough that it sizzles when you add a piece of meat.</li>
        <li>Brown the pork pieces for 4-5 minutes and remove the pork from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and garlic to the oil and pork drippings and saute for 7-10 minutes or until the onions start to brown.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat down a bit and add the cumin, paprika, and black pepper to the onions and garlic and mix well (it will be kind of pasty).</li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth to the onion mixture and mix well, making sure to scrape all the goodness off the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the pork back to the soup pot into the liquid and bring to a boil. Turn down to low.</li>
        <li>While the meat simmers, peel and wash the tomatillos. Dry them weel and in a large skillet over medium heat, char them along with the jalapeno, turning often, until the skins start to blacken.</li>
        <li>Place the charred tomatillos, jalapeno, cilantro, and lime juice into a food processor or blender and blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add to the pork in the soup pot and simmer for 2 to 2.5 hours or until the pork is fall apart tender.</li>
        <li>The sauce will reduce down and become thicker over the course of the cooking process. Serve with sliced avocado and cilantro for garnish.</li>
